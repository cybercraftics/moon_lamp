This is the homepage of the Moon Lamp project, as presented by myself in this [YouTube video]().

### Project Contents:
- [**3D Printable Materials**](https://github.com/cybercraftics/moon_lamp/tree/main/3d_printables)
- [**Arduino Code**](https://github.com/cybercraftics/moon_lamp/blob/main/src/main.cpp)

### Dependencies:
- "CapacitiveSensor" Arduino library

This project is a PlatformIO compatible and can be directly imported into any IDE with PlatformIO installed, such as Visual Studio Code.
Alternatively, the [code](https://github.com/cybercraftics/moon_lamp/blob/main/src/main.cpp) can be deployed through the 
Arduino IDE as well.
